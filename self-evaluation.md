# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel very confident with the each method. Straightforward and the cpu does the work :).
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
This was a definite productive struggle for me. At times I had to take breaks and ask for help from alumni.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I could still stand to brush up on some of these advanced concepts and formulation repitition. I plan on doing it this thursday before class. Take the day off and work through the material again.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
If I have any questions i will ask inside of the slack channels.
